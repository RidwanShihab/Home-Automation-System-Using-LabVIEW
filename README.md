Implementation of Home Automation System Using LabVIEW: This project deals with the
design of control and monitor systems for homes using LabVIEW software. This also
achieves the remote control operation. Need to control relay based light, dc motor, servo
motor and LED by monitoring the temperature, humidity , CO2 & CH4 gas and smoke. Also
need to use PIR for detecting human presence.
